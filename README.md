# About

Konkrete is a library mod used as base for my other mods.
This mod does nothing on its own and its only purpose is to be the base of other mods.

Technically, you are free to use this mod as base mod for your own mods, but there's currently no documentation for it, so it would probably be a very annoying experience.
